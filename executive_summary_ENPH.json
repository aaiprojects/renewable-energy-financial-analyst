      "summary": "- Current Trend: Over the last 30 days, ENPH has shown volatility with notable price movements; however, the general trend appears bearish as the close price has declined from a peak of approximately $39.22 to around $34.27.\n- Momentum: The relative price change indicates decreasing momentum, as recent closing prices are lower compared to earlier lows, signaling selling pressure.\n- Notable Levels: \n   - Resistance Level: The highest price in the recent history was around $39.22, suggesting this could be a key resistance level.\n   - Support Level: A notable support level could be identified at $33.57, being the lowest price observed in this period.\n- Volume Analysis: Trading volume fluctuated significantly, peaking at over 10 million in recent days, indicating heightened investor interest and potential market reactions to news or earnings releases.\n- Conclusion: ENPH appears to be in a bearish phase with diminishing momentum, which may present opportunities for short-term traders. Keeping an eye on the resistance level at $39.22 and support at $33.57 will be essential for future trading decisions.",
